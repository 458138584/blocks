Welcome to Blocks's documentation!
==================================

Blocks is a framework that helps you build neural network models on top of
Theano. It also helps you manage your model by doing error-checking, creating
monitoring channels, and allowing for easy configuration of your model. Features
include:

* Dimension, type and axes-checking
* Automatic creation of monitoring channels
* Easy pattern matching to select the bricks you want in large graphs
* Lazy initialization of bricks
* Application of graph transformations, such as dropout
